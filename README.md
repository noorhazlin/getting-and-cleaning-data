# getting-and-cleaning-data

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data called tidy_data.txt.
One R script called run_analysis.R was created that does the following:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
